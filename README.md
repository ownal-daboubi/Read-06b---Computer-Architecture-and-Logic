# Read-06b---Computer-Architecture-and-Logic
What makes a computer a compter.

it is a machine desined and build to help us with a thinking job. like solving equations and tracking the stars
 in the sky.it is designed to manipulate informations. it works in for stages as follows (input,storage,processing,output).
input is the commaand that a person do on a computer.These commands will be stored in a memory.Using Algorithim the informations 
are processed.then the informations are deisplayed as an output.

How computers works : Binary and data
computers works on binary systems o101(true or false).there is a wires and circuits that carries all the informations we need.we use wires 
and the more wires we use the more bits we have. it translates the texts into a binary coding system.

how computers work circuits and logic.
A computer uses millions of tiny electronic components which are called circuits.There are many closed circuits like(AND,NAND,NOT,NOR).
These circuits are too many and they work in acomplex fast way.

How Computers Work: CPU, Memory, Input & Output
computer works like this input (converts the physical input into a binary information). Memory(store the information).Cpu
(central processing unit calculates the information).Output(converts from binary to physical information).

How Computers Work: Hardware and Software
hardware consists of (circuits,chips,wires,speakers etc). software is a computer program codes that are runing on the computer
like (apps,games,websites..etc).CPU combines the software with the hardwate.CPU recieves simple commands that tell which circuits to use.
